    "### In first part we have only known about calculating slope with respect to b in (b_new = b_old - n * slope) keeping m constant but what if m is not constant.Then in this case we have to calculate this slope by differentiating Loss function with respect to both m and b.At first we have to choose the random value of m and b.Then we have to calculate the loss_slope_of_m and loss_slope_of_b then using that loss slope we have to calculate the new value of b and m and find Y_predict with that new value and repeat this process until certain epoch and after some instant we will get approximate value for m and b"
