    "## Train test split is one of the widely used method for use of available data by splitting the data in training and testing data.Lets understand the limitation of train test split using example.For example if we train our kid with algebra problem and if test is done with linear problem then there may be chance that he fails <br><br>Another alternative to train test split is K fold validation which is also a method for  best use of available data by splitting teh available dataset into different folds.And iterate through each fold where for ith fold, test the model with ith fold and train it with remaining i-1 fold."

    "### How above thing works:<br><br>Since we have made four splits,so our algorithm will be creating four folds/subset ,in each iteration 1 fold will be created as test data and other 3 will be as training data.For eg:<br><br>In iteration one test: fold1  training:fold2,fold3,fold4:<br><br>In iteration 2 test: fold2  training:fold1,fold3,fold4:<br><br>In iteration 3 test: fold3  training:fold1,fold2,fold4:<br><br>In iteration 4 test: fold4  training:fold1,fold2fold3.<br><br>above for loop will run for 4 times,each time with different training and testing index hence giving different accuracy score in each iteration which in above case is stored in LR_ACCURACY_FOR_4_ITERATION.So this accuracy will be calculated by finding the average of each accuracy"
